        <p>
            As indicated in the 2024-2028 GDR MACS roadmap, data-driven methods are on the rise in the control community, 
            thanks in particular to recent advances based on the use of AI (reinforcement learning, representation of a 
            system by an “informative” trajectory thanks to the Willems lemma and the methods derived from it). In automatic control,
            data-driven approaches are particularly interesting when the construction of a model is complex, and their development
            could enable to broaden the range of applications for control. Data-driven analysis methods have also been developed
            to analyse the resulting closed loops.
        </p>
        
        <br>
        <p>
            This topic is of growing interest to the international community, and the objective of this workshop is to gather
            the GDR MACS members developing such data-driven approaches. This workshop is part of a GDR MACS funded project. We are counting on this workshop to get a picture of 
            the research and teaching activities on this topic at the french national level, and to initiate a national dynamic on these subjects.

            <br><i>Safe Reinforcement Learning with provable guarantees: Recent Advancements</i></li>
            <br> This talk presents recent advances in Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) methodologies applicable to both discrete-time and continuous-time systems with provable guarantees.
            The talk will introduce reinforcement learning (Adaptive Dynamic Programming) and motivate Safe RL. Then, Safe RL  approaches developed for discrete-time systems will be presented 
            where safety is enforced by augumenting Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) into the reward structure, thereby ensuring the forward invariance of predefined safe sets. The presentation
            then turns to the Safe Exploration problem, highlighting how Input-to-State Stability (ISS) properties can be exploited to maintain safety during the exploration phase. In this context,
            the concept of Input-to-State Safety (ISSf) is introduced, offering a novel framework that promotes rich, risk-aware exploration while preserving formal safety guarantees, thereby
            enabling more informative exploration and improved tracking performance. The talk further covers recent developments addressing input saturation constraints, strategies for 
            boundary-focused exploration, and model-free methods for system dynamics learning, contributing to a more robust and generalizable Safe RL framework.

            <br> We extend the Loewner framework to multivariate (dynamical) functions (and systems) with an arbitrary number "n" of variables (or parameters).
            The presentation go through the following contributions: (i) first, we show how from a n-dimensional data tensor we can construct an approximating
            n-variable rational function; (ii) second, we detail a methodology to both reduce the computational burden and memory needs to achieve (i) with exact
            arithmetic, by replacing the null-space construction of a (large-scale) n-dimensional Loewner matrix, with a series of null-space construction of 
            (limited size) 1-dimensional Loewner matrices; (iii) third, as a consequence of (ii), we show that the proposed approach achieves variables decoupling
            and provides a scalable numerical approach to the Kolmogorov Superposition Theorem applied to rational functions, bridging the gap between approximation
            theory and the neural network community. A collection of numerical examples and method comparison illustrates the effectiveness and scalability of 
            the proposed method and its ability to tame the Curse of Dimensionality.

            <br><i>A hybrid systems framework for data-based adaptive control of linear time-varying systems</i>
            <br>We consider the problem of stabilization of unknown discrete-time linear time-varying systems using an adaptive data-driven control approach. 
            The controller is defined as a linear state-feedback law whose gain is adapted to the plant changes through a data-based event-triggering rule. 
            To do so, we monitor the evolution of a data-based Lyapunov function along the solution. When this Lyapunov function does not satisfy a designed 
            desirable condition, an episode is triggered to update the controller gain and the corresponding Lyapunov function using the last collected 
            data. The resulting closed-loop dynamics hence exhibits both physical jumps, due to the system dynamics, and episodic jumps, which naturally 
            leads to a hybrid discrete-time system. We leverage the inherent robustness of the controller and provide general conditions under which various 
            stability notions can be established for the system. Two notable cases where these conditions can be established a-priori based on system’s properties 
            and time-variations are treated, and numerical results illustrating the relevance of the approach and comparing it with alternative approaches are 
            discussed. This is a joint work with Andrea Iannelli (Univ. of Stuttgart, Germany).</li>

            <br><i>A nonlinear KKL framework for theoretical analysis and guarantees of neural network observers</i>
            <br>This presentation addresses the state estimation problem for nonlinear dynamical systems. Modern approaches that use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
            for the observer’s internal dynamics and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) for the output mapping are popular but often lack theoretical guarantees. We show
            how these structures can be analyzed through the lens of Kazantzis-Kravaris-Luenberger (KKL) observers. We extend this theory to the case where the RNN 
            implements nonlinear contracting dynamics, leveraging the theory of input-driven contracting systems. We demonstrate the existence of a transformation 
            enabling state reconstruction, analogous to the KKL map, and prove that the structure comprising a Contracting Nonlinear Filter (implementable by an
            RNN) and an MLP output map constitutes a tunable observer, thereby providing convergence guarantees. Finally, we discuss the potential benefits of using specific 
            nonlinearities to improve the trade-off between convergence speed and noise robustness.</li>

            <br><i>Data-Based Sliding Mode Control - Application to Floating Offshore Wind Turbines</i>
            <br>This talk presents a data-driven control approach combining online neural networks with sliding
            mode theory to handle nonlinear systems with unknown dynamics. The control design employs
            an integral sliding mode control (ISMC) approach enhanced by two neural network (NN) approx-
            imators. These NNs are adapted online using Lyapunov-based adaptation laws and require no
            offline pre-training. This ensures real-time adaptability and robustness against disturbances and
            modeling uncertainties.
            As a case study, the framework is applied to a floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) operating
            in above-rated wind conditions, where aerodynamic and hydrodynamic complexities pose major
            control challenges. Simulations using the NREL 5-MW turbine model within the OpenFAST
            environment demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms both standard ISMC
            and the widely used reference open-source controller (ROSCO)</li>
