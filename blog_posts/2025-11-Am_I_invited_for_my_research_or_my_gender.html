											<h2>Am I invited for my research or because of my gender? <br> My unexpected plenary and the conversations it sparked</h2>
											
										</header>
										<p>November 6th, 2025</p>
										
										<h3>Inaugurating My Blog: A Personal and Professional Commitment</h3>

										<p>I’ve wanted to start a blog for a long time, but I never knew how—or with what—to begin. 
										Now, I can’t imagine a more fitting way to launch it than by sharing something deeply personal 
										yet profoundly professional: my commitment to fostering a more inclusive STEM community and advancing gender equality.</p>
										
										<h3>From Short Talk to Plenary: Addressing Gender Imbalance from the Podium</h3>
										
										<p>A few weeks back, I participated in <a href="https://gds.gdr-macs.fr/">Grand Séminaire MACS</a> on <i>Learnin and dynamical systems</i>,
										where I was originally invited to deliver a 30-minute talk on my work in data-driven control.</p>

										<p>However, all the plenary talks (each an hour long) had initially been assigned to male researchers. Given our insitution (CNRS Informatique) strong stance 
										on gender equality, they intervened, asking the organizers to address this imbalance. That’s how, just two weeks before the event (and in the midst of finalizing an ERC submission),
										I found myself invited to give a one-hour plenary talk. I accepted immediately as I was honored by the opportunity, but the short notice also brought its share of pressure.</p>

										<p>At the opening of the event, the head of GDR MACS (a man) publicly acknowledged the oversight. Throughout the first day, several female colleagues approached me to share their
										thoughts on the situation. Some confessed they would have declined the invitation, unwilling to be seen as mere “tokens” fulfilling parity rules that are often misunderstood or poorly implemented. 
										Their words resonated deeply, and I realized I needed to address this issue—not just as a speaker, but as a woman in STEM.</p>

										<p>And that's what I did. I decided to dedicate a few minutes to a topic that mattered just as much as my research: the experience of being a female scientist in such contexts. Here are more or less the opening lines that I prepared last minute:</p>
										
										<div class="container">
										<div class="text">
											<p>"<i>My presentation will be a bit “staccato” as my slot went from 30 minutes to 1 hour quite late in the process. I would love to believe it is because my work is absolutely fascinating,
										but I suspect it might also have something to do with Dimitri’s introductory speech on gender equality this morning.</i></p>

										<p><i>This discussion naturally arose during the breaks today, mostly with the few women in this room, as it is a very common and shared feeling among us, to wonder if we are invited for
										what our work or because we are women.</i></p>

										<p><i>I’ll take it as an opportunity though. Progress on this equality matter indeed starts with a checkbox, but it also offers us the possibility to make it real and to make the next
										invitations feel more natural, when we fill that space with substance. And us women in control know how to do.</i></p>

										<p><i>You all have have this wonderful influence to create that space to make our community more diverse, inclusive and therefore more thriving.</i></p>

										<p><i>Now let’s get to it.</i>"</p>

										<p>My hands were sligthly shaking as I delivered those words. It may not seem like much, but in that moment, it felt like delivering a plenary in itself. 
										The nods of approval from the other women in the room gave me courage. I took a few seconds to collect my thoughts before shifting to my scientific presentation,
										when someone (I found out later it was Antonio Loria) began to applaud. The entire amphitheater followed.</p>

										<p>For the rest of the workshop, both men and women approached me to congratulate me on addressing the issue so openly.
										I was delighted, not just by the reception, but by the realization that speaking up had made an impact. It was a moment I’ll never forget.</p>

										<h3>Personnal reflections on actions to be taken</h3>

										<p>Addressing gender imbalance in academia is a complex, multifaceted challenge. There is no one-size-fits-all solution that works across all disciplines or cultural contexts. 
										However, progress is possible when we combine institutional accountability with individual agency. Here are some thoughts on how I believe we can move forward.</p>

										<h4>Institutional and individual accountability</h4>
										
										<p>Our institutions have a crucial role to play in combating gender imbalance by implementing and enforcing rules that promote equity. For example, in France, selection committees
										for assistant professor positions are required to include a balanced representation of genders (at least 40% of each gender). PhD committees are encouraged to be as balanced as possible,
										and many doctoral schools impose the presence of at least one person of each gender. Similarly, conference organizing teams and boards should actively seek gender diversity in their 
										composition but also in the way they distribute plenary talks, awards and responsibilities. This should not be just to meet quotas, but to ensure a range of perspectives and experiences 
										are represented. I invite you to read Carolyn Beck's editos of Control Systems Magazine on that matter (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11180759">here</a> and 
										<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10947075">there</a>).</p>

										<p>While this is a step in the right direction, it also places an additional burden on the few female researchers who are often called upon to serve on multiple committees, adding to
										their already heavy load of community and service work. This is where individual actions can make a difference and complement institutional actions. Here are three suggestions, simple in theory,
										yet not enough put into practice in my opinion.
										<li><b>Set boundaries:</b> As an oversollicited woman in academia, protecting your time and energy is essential. I personally limit myself to a maximum of two selection committees and 
										two to three PhD committees per year, and I accept only if I believe my expertise is genuinely relevant to the topic. This approach ensures that my participation is meaningful, allowing
										me to network, foster collaborations, and nurture new ideas, rather than spreading myself too thin. </li>
										<li><b>Make women visible:</b> One of the main challenges is that female researchers are often not well identified. Whenever you’re asked for a name, whether for a committee, a speaking opportunity,
										or a collaboration, everyone should make a conscious effort to think of both a male and a female candidate. Push yourself to think outside the box and consider individuals who might not immediately come to mind.</li>
										<li><b>Be polite and respectful:</b> Never invite a woman by explicitly stating that it’s because of her gender. It really feels like kicking open doors, but it remains unfortunately a very cmmon mistake.
										Women are all aware of what’s at stake, and such remarks are not only rude but disrespectful of their work. You wouldn’t invite a man because of his gender or a senior person because of their age, so why do it to a woman? 
										Women already face enough doubt and scrutiny: there’s no need to feed that fire. I systematically refuse invitations that mention parity rules as the reason for my inclusion: their loss, not mine.</li>
										</p>

										<h4>What women can do</h4>

										<p>For women navigating these spaces, here are a few suggestions based on my own starting journey.										
										<li><b>Speak up:</b> Over the past decade, we’ve seen real change in how openly we can discuss the experience of being a woman in STEM, but also in society in general with the different 
										metoo movements. Breaking the silence is never easy, but the first step is often the hardest. Once you start, you’ll find you’re not alone—and your voice can inspire others to do the same.</li>
										<li><b>Tame your impostor syndrome:</b> Easier said than done, I know! I am still in the process myself... It’s all too common for women in STEM, whether in academia or industry, to question whether they belong or deserve their achievements.
										The answer is yes, you do! Progress starts with believing in yourself, even when the system makes it difficult. To improve on this matter, I believe mentorship initiatives are a great way to go 
										(see the <a href="https://www.femmesetsciences.fr/mentorat">example</a> of Femmes et Sciences), and networking with other women in your field can also constitute a helpful and supportive network 
										(through IEEE dedicated chapters for instance, or by joining <a href="https://www.femmesetsciences.fr/">Femmes et Sciences</a>, or by staring or participating in local initiatives in your labs or faculties).</li>
										</p>

										<h3>Is change really happening?</h3>
										<p>One question I keep coming back to is whether the progress we’re seeing is genuine systemic change or simply performative. Are we addressing the root causes of inequality, or are we just checking boxes to
										comply with rules that are set at institutional levels? Real change requires more than policies: it demands a shift in culture, attitudes, and everyday practices.</p>

										<h3>Let’s Keep the Conversation Going</h3>
										<p>If you’d like to share your own experiences, thoughts, or ideas on this topic, I’d love to hear from you!</p>
